## Process:

- Data Cleaning - Sorting and Filtering Data. So that we can make it more clean, accessible and easy to read & understand.

- Data Processing – Adding 2 new rows to make the work and analysis easy. 
  1.	Month Row = To filter down all the months from date column.
  2.	Age Group Row = Used IF command to narrow down the age group of peoples (0 to 25 = Teenagers, 
      26 to 50 = Adults and Rest Seniors)


- Data Analysis – Created different worksheets to analyse all the data and then created a Pivot Table.

- Data Visualisation – After analysing all the data using Pivot Table, I started creating a visual report so that it will be easier for the company to understand all the data visually without changing the worksheets.

- Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra are the top 3 channels from where the customers are buying products.

- Most of the products are getting delivered (~90%).


## Final Conclusion:
To improve the sales of Vrinda Store in 2023 and 2024, a strategic marketing plan should be developed with a strong focus on women aged 25 to 49 years, primarily residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. This demographic is crucial because women in this age group are often the primary decision-makers for household and lifestyle-related purchases, making them a high-value customer segment for the store.

The strategy should include targeted digital marketing campaigns, region-specific advertisements, and personalized promotions that align with their needs and preferences. By leveraging social media platforms, influencer marketing, and data-driven advertisements, Vrinda Store can build stronger visibility among this audience. Additionally, loyalty programs, personalized product recommendations, and exclusive offers will help not only in attracting this segment but also in retaining them as long-term customers.

Focusing on this demographic and regional strategy will allow Vrinda Store to expand its customer base, strengthen its market presence, and achieve consistent sales growth during 2023 and 2024.
